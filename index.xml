      <title>Bypassing MAX_PATH Limit with GHC on Windows</title>

      <description>TL;DR: GHC 8.10+ Will ship with a custom GCC+Binutils bindist that will remove the MAX_PATH limitation to files. The GHC binaries themselves must still be in installed in a path shorter than MAX_PATH. GHC 8.6 and GHC 8.8 are also supported if installed via chocolatey by installing the extension ghc-jailbreak. For cabal to work correctly you need a cabal compiled with GHC 8.6+, on chocolatey this means cabal 2.</description>

      <description>You have a new package you want to try out. You try to install the package only to be greeted with
GHCi, version 8.2.2: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/ :? for help &amp;lt;command line&amp;gt;: user specified .o/.so/.DLL could not be loaded (addDLL: my-cool-library or dependencies not loaded. (Win32 error 126)) Whilst trying to load: (dynamic) my-cool-library Additional directories searched: (none)  by GHCi. Confused you look into your libraries folder and see my-cool-library-7.dll. Why is the file name incorrect?</description>

      <description>For those who are unaware, Windows has had quite a push lately to provide script-able ways to install packages. One such attempt that has gained quite a lot of traction is Chocolatey https://chocolatey.org/.
Chocolatey also contains some of my own packages for installing GHC and cabal (along with packages to fully automate setting up a GHC dev environment etc, more on these at a later date).
The GHC package https://chocolatey.</description>
